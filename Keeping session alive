Hi Prem,

We wanted to provide an update on the issue with the Snowflake Address column, where data exceeding 16 MB in length cannot be stored.

Issue:
We identified that the Address column in Snowflake is unable to retain data if the data length exceeds 16 MB.

Solution:
To address this, we explored several compression techniques, including ZLIB, Snappy, and ZSTD. Among these, we observed the best results with ZSTD, where 40 MB of data was compressed down to approximately 4046 bytes.

For this compression, we implemented a UDF approach in Spark. Due to the nature of this solution, the Spark application might require higher resources to process the data effectively.

Next Steps:
The Framework team will generate a JAR file with the necessary code for this solution and share an updated image for testing purposes.

Let us know if you have any questions or if further clarification is needed.

Best regards,
