To use Apache Spark with Kerberos authentication in Scala, you typically need to ensure that your Spark environment is properly configured to communicate with the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) and that you have a valid Kerberos ticket.

Here is a high-level example of how you might write Scala code for Spark that uses Kerberos for authentication. Note that actual production code will depend on the specifics of your Kerberos setup, Hadoop configuration, and Spark environment.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation
import org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration

object SparkKerberosExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // Configure Spark to use Kerberos
    val sparkConf = new SparkConf()
      .setAppName("SparkKerberosExample")
      // Set master to local for testing; in production, this would be set to your cluster's master
      .setMaster("local[*]") 
      // Set Hadoop configuration properties for Kerberos
      .set("spark.hadoop.fs.hdfs.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DistributedFileSystem")
      .set("spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.authentication", "kerberos")

    val sc = new SparkContext(sparkConf)

    // Assuming you have already logged in via kinit or a keytab is available
    UserGroupInformation.setConfiguration(new Configuration())
    UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab("your-principal-name@YOUR.REALM", "/path/to/your.keytab")

    // Now you can interact with HDFS/S3/any data source that requires Kerberos authentication
    val rdd = sc.textFile("hdfs://your-kerberized-hdfs-cluster/path/to/file")

    // Your Spark job logic goes here
    val lineCount = rdd.count()
    println(s"Total number of lines: $lineCount")

    // Stop the Spark context
    sc.stop()
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `your-principal-name@YOUR.REALM` and `/path/to/your.keytab` with your actual Kerberos principal name and keytab file path.

Additionally, you will need to make sure that your `krb5.conf` and `core-site.xml` files are correctly configured for your environment, and these files should be available to your Spark application, typically placed in the `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR` or `$SPARK_CONF_DIR` directory.

Before running this Scala code, you need to ensure that your environment is set up for Spark and Hadoop, and you have the necessary Kerberos configurations in place. This usually involves a fair amount of setup outside of the code itself, including network configurations, Kerberos principal creation, and more.
