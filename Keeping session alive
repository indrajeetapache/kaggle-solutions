The main goal of ensuring idempotency is to avoid duplicate data entries in the target table. Concurrently, the framework should possess the intelligence to identify any issues and have the capability to recover autonomously. In situations where a failure transpires on a specific day, it's advised that the support team abstain from executing the designated CMD job. Instead, they should initiate the complete pipeline. Furthermore, if a file has been previously executed leading to data insertion in the target table, the framework should recognize this, refrain from inserting the data again, and exit gracefully with an exit code of -0
