Subject: Request for 3-Day Leave due to Wife's Health Condition

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence for three days, starting from [starting date, e.g., "today, August 29th"] to [end date, e.g., "August 31st"], due to a critical family situation.

Recently, my wife underwent a surgery for her ACL and ligament. The surgery was necessary and unavoidable due to her deteriorating health condition. She is currently hospitalized, and as per the doctor's advice, she will remain under observation until Monday. Given the circumstances, my presence by her side during this challenging time is essential, not only for emotional support but also to manage various medical decisions, paperwork, and post-surgical care requirements.

I assure you that I have taken measures to ensure that my absence will cause minimal disruption to the team's workflow. [If applicable, you can mention: "I have delegated my pending tasks to [colleague's name] and have provided a detailed handover to ensure that there are no delays in any ongoing projects."]

I genuinely hope for your understanding and support in this matter. While I aim to be as available as possible, I might be slightly delayed in responding to urgent matters. If you need any further details or documentation to support this leave request, please let me know, and I will provide them promptly.

I deeply apologize for any inconvenience this might cause and appreciate your kind consideration. I will ensure to catch up on my return and ensure a smooth transition back to my responsibilities.

Thank you for your understanding, and I hope to be back to work by [return date, e.g., "Tuesday, September 1st"].

Warm regards,

[Your Full Name]
