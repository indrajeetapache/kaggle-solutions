### Title: Extend File Ingestion Framework to Support Multiline Files with Multi-Character Delimiters

**Story ID:** [Unique ID]

#### Description:

**Objective:** The aim of this story is to enhance our file ingestion framework to efficiently process multiline files that use multi-character delimiters. This functionality is crucial for handling complex data formats often found in logs, advanced data streams, and certain types of legacy data systems.

**Background:** Our current framework efficiently handles single-line records with common delimiters (like commas, tabs, etc.). However, as we increasingly encounter data sources with multiline records and unconventional multi-character delimiters, the need for this extended functionality has become apparent. These data sources include verbose logging systems, nested data structures, and custom-formatted export files.

**Requirements:**
1. **Multiline Record Parsing:** The framework should be equipped to correctly parse and ingest data from files with records spanning multiple lines.

2. **Multi-Character Delimiter Support:** It should handle files with multi-character delimiters, ensuring that data is accurately separated and processed.

3. **Robust Parsing Algorithm:** Develop a robust parsing algorithm that can correctly identify record boundaries and field delimiters, even in complex, nested, or irregular data structures.

4. **Configurability:** Users should be able to specify the delimiter characters and the criteria for identifying record boundaries.

5. **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to address issues like malformed records, unexpected file formats, and delimiter inconsistencies.

6. **Performance Considerations:** Ensure the parsing mechanism is optimized for performance, particularly for large files and high-throughput scenarios.

7. **Documentation and Examples:** Provide detailed documentation and usage examples, specifically highlighting cases with nested data structures and multiline records.

8. **Testing and Validation:** Develop a suite of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks, to validate the functionality across various file types and sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Accurate Parsing:** The framework should accurately parse multiline files with multi-character delimiters without data loss or corruption.

2. **Configurability and Flexibility:** Users should be able to easily configure the system for different file formats and delimiters.

3. **Performance Benchmarks:** The solution must meet predefined performance benchmarks for file processing speed and resource utilization.

4. **Documentation and Example Completeness:** All documentation and examples should be comprehensive, clear, and validated for accuracy.

5. **Test Coverage and Success:** Achieve full test coverage for the new features with all tests passing.

#### Notes:
- Engage with stakeholders to gather examples of target file formats for testing purposes.
- Review potential edge cases in file formats to ensure robustness in parsing logic.
- Consider potential integration points with existing data validation and transformation features in the framework.
