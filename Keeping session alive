Sure, let's design an architecture to automate the process of generating Minutes of Meeting (MOM) from a Zoom call and then sending them to the required participants. 

### Architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - **Zoom API**: Fetch the meeting transcript and participant details.
   
2. **Processing Layer**:
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the raw transcript by removing fillers, repetitions, or irrelevant parts.
   - **NLP Processing**:
     - **Participant Identification**: Identify distinct speakers.
     - **Topic Segmentation**: Categorize the content into topics.
     - **Key Point Extraction**: Extract main points.
     - **Action Item Detection**: Extract tasks and action items.
     - **Decision Identification**: Highlight decisions made.
     
3. **MOM Generation Layer**:
   - Compile the processed data into a structured MOM format.

4. **Distribution Layer**:
   - **Email Service**: To send out the MOM to the participants.

5. **Feedback Layer**:
   - Optional UI where participants can view and provide feedback on the generated MOM, leading to continuous improvement.

### Tools & Technologies:

1. **Zoom API**:
   - Used to fetch the transcript and the list of participants.

2. **NLP & Machine Learning**:
   - **spaCy** or **NLTK**: For basic preprocessing, tokenization, and language tasks.
   - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: For topic modeling. This can be done using the `gensim` library.
   - **PyTorch** (or TensorFlow): For deep learning-based models, especially if you're looking at transformer models for more complex tasks like abstractive summarization or custom action item detection.

3. **Database (Optional)**:
   - Store processed MOMs, feedback, and other relevant data. Options include relational databases like **PostgreSQL** or NoSQL databases like **MongoDB**.

4. **Email Service**:
   - Services like **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**, or even **SMTP** servers to automate the sending of MOMs.

5. **Web Framework (For Feedback UI)**:
   - **Django** or **Flask** for Python-based applications to create a web interface.

### Workflow:

1. Once the Zoom meeting ends, trigger an event (Webhook or scheduled job) to fetch the transcript and participant details from Zoom API.
2. Preprocess the data, including cleaning and segmentation.
3. Use NLP models to extract topics, key points, action items, and decisions. If using PyTorch, this is where you'd leverage trained models to parse and understand the content.
4. Compile the extracted information into a structured MOM format.
5. Use the email service to distribute the MOM to the participants.
6. (Optional) Allow participants to access a UI where they can review the MOM and provide feedback for improvement.
7. Use feedback for continuous improvement of the system.

### Points to Note:

- **Training Data**: If using machine learning or deep learning, ensure you have adequate and relevant training data. This is essential for tasks like action item detection or abstractive summarization.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous feedback will help refine the generated MOMs over time, making them more accurate and relevant.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Ensure that all processing and storage adhere to data privacy standards and regulations, especially since meeting transcripts can contain sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: If dealing with numerous meetings and MOMs, ensure that the infrastructure can handle the load and process data efficiently.

By combining NLP tools (like spaCy or NLTK) with deep learning frameworks (like PyTorch), you can build a robust system for automating the creation and distribution of MOMs from Zoom calls.
