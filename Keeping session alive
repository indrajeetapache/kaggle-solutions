Subject: Request for One Month Medical Leave

Dear [Manager's Name / Management Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request a medical leave of absence for one month due to a recent injury. I unfortunately suffered a right knee ACL tear and medial meniscus tear, requiring immediate surgical intervention and subsequent recovery.

My physician has strongly advised complete bed rest for a duration of one month, post-surgery, to ensure optimal recovery and avoid complications. I understand the significance of my role in the team, and I assure you that I will do my utmost to ensure a smooth workflow in my absence.

I have attached the detailed surgery report and medical certificate for your reference. I will remain reachable in case of any emergencies or should there be any need for clarification regarding ongoing projects. I recommend [Colleagueâ€™s Name or Team Lead's Name] as a potential point of contact during my absence.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time. I am committed to returning to work as soon as I am medically cleared and will keep you updated on my progress.

Warm regards,
