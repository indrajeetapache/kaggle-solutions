Having dedicated over three years to managing Build Verification Tests (BVTs), I am now eager to shift my career trajectory to enhance my learning curve. I aspire to join an Application team where I can leverage my functional knowledge and automation skills. To facilitate this transition, I seek opportunities that will allow me to deepen my expertise in application development, coupled with mentorship in advanced automation techniques, to contribute meaningfully to the team and broaden my professional repertoire."
