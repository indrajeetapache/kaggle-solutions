Requirements:

Avro File Reading: The framework should be able to read Avro files efficiently. This includes handling both schema and schema-less Avro data.
Schema Management: It should manage and interpret Avro schemas. This includes the ability to handle schema evolution where the schema may change over time, ensuring compatibility with older versions of the data.
Integration with Existing Systems: The Avro file support must integrate seamlessly with the existing framework, without disrupting current functionalities. This requires thorough testing to ensure compatibility.
Performance Optimization: The implementation should be optimized for performance, ensuring that the ingestion of Avro files is as efficient as possible.
Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms should be in place to deal with issues like corrupted files, schema mismatches, and other potential anomalies.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation should be provided, detailing how to use the new Avro file reading capabilities, including examples and best practices.
Testing: Extensive unit and integration tests must be written to cover all new code. This includes tests for various Avro file scenarios, schema evolution cases, and performance benchmarks.
Acceptance Criteria:

Successful Avro File Reading: The system should be able to read Avro files of various sizes and schemas without errors.
Schema Evolution Handling: The framework must correctly handle different versions of Avro schemas.
No Regression: Existing functionalities of the file ingestion framework should remain intact and perform as expected.
Documentation Completion: All documentation related to Avro file support should be completed and reviewed.
Testing Coverage: Code coverage for new functionality should meet or exceed the project's standard threshold.
