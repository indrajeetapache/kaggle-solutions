# Day 1 - Prompting

Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!

This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.


## Before you begin

In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.

* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,
* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,
* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.


### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI

In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.

AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.

If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.
## Get started with Kaggle notebooks

If this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome! You can read about how to use Kaggle notebooks [in the docs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks).

First, you will need to phone verify your account at kaggle.com/settings.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5dgai_0.png)
To run this notebook, as well as the others in this course, you will need to make a copy, or fork, the notebook. Look for the `Copy and Edit` button in the top-right, and **click it** to make an editable, private copy of the notebook. It should look like this one:

![Copy and Edit button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_1.png)

Your copy will now have a ▶️ **Run** button next to each code cell that you can press to execute that cell. These notebooks are expected to be run in order from top-to-bottom, but you are encouraged to add new cells, run your own code and explore. If you get stuck, you can try the `Factory reset` option in the `Run` menu, or head back to the original notebook and make a fresh copy.

![Run cell button](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_2.png)

### Problems?

If you have any problems, head over to the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle), find the [`#5dgai-q-and-a` channel](https://discord.com/channels/1101210829807956100/1303438695143178251) and ask for help.
## Get started with the Gemini API

All of the exercises in this notebook will use the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) by way of the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/). Each of these prompts can be accessed directly in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) too, so if you would rather use a web interface and skip the code for this activity, look for the <img src="https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png" style="height: 24px" height=24/> AI Studio link on each prompt.
Next, you will need to add your API key to your Kaggle Notebook as a Kaggle User Secret.

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5dgai_1.png)
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5dgai_2.png)
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5dgai_3.png)
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5dgai_4.png)
### Install the SDK
%pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.8.3"
import google.generativeai as genai
from IPython.display import HTML, Markdown, display
### Set up your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a [Kaggle secret](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/114053) named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

If you don't already have an API key, you can grab one from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). You can find [detailed instructions in the docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).

To make the key available through Kaggle secrets, choose `Secrets` from the `Add-ons` menu and follow the instructions to add your key or enable it for this notebook.
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
If you received an error response along the lines of `No user secrets exist for kernel id ...`, then you need to add your API key via `Add-ons`, `Secrets` **and** enable it.

![Screenshot of the checkbox to enable GOOGLE_API_KEY secret](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/Images/5gdai_sc_3.png)
### Run your first prompt

In this step, you will test that your API key is set up correctly by making a request. The `gemini-1.5-flash` model has been selected here.
flash = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
response = flash.generate_content("Explain AI to me like I'm a kid.")
print(response.text)
The response often comes back in markdown format, which you can render directly in this notebook.
Markdown(response.text)
### Start a chat

The previous example uses a single-turn, text-in/text-out structure, but you can also set up a multi-turn chat structure too.
chat = flash.start_chat(history=[])
response = chat.send_message('Hello! My name is Indrajit.')
print(response.text)
response = chat.send_message('Can you tell something interesting about dinosaurs?')
print(response.text)
# While you have the `chat` object around, the conversation state
# persists. Confirm that by asking if it knows my name.
response = chat.send_message('Do you remember what my name is?')
print(response.text)
### Choose a model

The Gemini API provides access to a number of models from the Gemini model family. Read about the available models and their capabilities on the [model overview page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini).

In this step you'll use the API to list all of the available models.
for model in genai.list_models():
  print(model.name)
The [`models.list`](https://ai.google.dev/api/models#method:-models.list) response also returns additional information about the model's capabilities, like the token limits and supported parameters.
for model in genai.list_models():
  if model.name == 'models/gemini-1.5-flash':
    print(model)
    break
## Explore generation parameters


### Output length

When generating text with an LLM, the output length affects cost and performance. Generating more tokens increases computation, leading to higher energy consumption, latency, and cost.

To stop the model from generating tokens past a limit, you can specify the `max_output_length` parameter when using the Gemini API. Specifying this parameter does not influence the generation of the output tokens, so the output will not become more stylistically or textually succinct, but it will stop generating tokens once the specified length is reached. Prompt engineering may be required to generate a more complete output for your given limit.
short_model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(max_output_tokens=200))

response = short_model.generate_content('Write a 1000 word essay on the importance of olives in modern society.')
print(response.text)
response = short_model.generate_content('Write a short poem on the importance of olives in modern society.')
print(response.text)
Explore with your own prompts. Try a prompt with a restrictive output limit and then adjust the prompt to work within that limit.
### Temperature

Temperature controls the degree of randomness in token selection. Higher temperatures result in a higher number of candidate tokens from which the next output token is selected, and can produce more diverse results, while lower temperatures have the opposite effect, such that a temperature of 0 results in greedy decoding, selecting the most probable token at each step.

Temperature doesn't provide any guarantees of randomness, but it can be used to "nudge" the output somewhat.
high_temp_model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(temperature=2.0))

for _ in range(5):
  response = high_temp_model.generate_content('Pick a random colour... (answer in a single word)')
  if response.parts:
    print(response.text, '-' * 25)
Now try the same prompt with temperature set to zero. Note that the output is not completely deterministic, as other parameters affect token selection, but the results will tend to be more stable.
low_temp_model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(temperature=0.0))

for _ in range(5):
  response = low_temp_model.generate_content('Pick a random colour... (answer in a single word)')
  if response.parts:
    print(response.text, '-' * 25)
### Top-K and top-P

Like temperature, top-K and top-P parameters are also used to control the diversity of the model's output.

Top-K is a positive integer that defines the number of most probable tokens from which to select the output token. A top-K of 1 selects a single token, performing greedy decoding.

Top-P defines the probability threshold that, once cumulatively exceeded, tokens stop being selected as candidates. A top-P of 0 is typically equivalent to greedy decoding, and a top-P of 1 typically selects every token in the model's vocabulary.

When both are supplied, the Gemini API will filter top-K tokens first, then top-P and then finally sample from the candidate tokens using the supplied temperature.

Run this example a number of times, change the settings and observe the change in output.
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        # These are the default values for gemini-1.5-flash-001.
        temperature=1.0,
        top_k=64,
        top_p=0.95,
    ))

story_prompt = "You are a creative writer. Write a short story about a cat who goes on an adventure."
response = model.generate_content(story_prompt)
print(response.text)
## Prompting

This section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API. Try changing the text here to see how each prompt performs with different instructions, more examples, or any other changes you can think of.
### Zero-shot

Zero-shot prompts are prompts that describe the request for the model directly.

<table align=left>
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1gzKKgDHwkAvexG5Up0LMtl1-6jKMKe4g"><img src="https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png" style="height: 24px" height=24/> Open in AI Studio</a>
  </td>
</table>
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        temperature=0.1,
        top_p=1,
        max_output_tokens=5,
    ))

zero_shot_prompt = """Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.
Review: "Her" is a disturbing study revealing the direction
humanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,
unchecked. I wish there were more movies like this masterpiece.
Sentiment: """

response = model.generate_content(zero_shot_prompt)
print(response.text)
#### Enum mode

The models are trained to generate text, and can sometimes produce more text than you may wish for. In the preceding example, the model will output the label, sometimes it can include a preceding "Sentiment" label, and without an output token limit, it may also add explanatory text afterwards.

The Gemini API has an [Enum mode](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Enum.ipynb) feature that allows you to constrain the output to a fixed set of values.
import enum

class Sentiment(enum.Enum):
    POSITIVE = "positive"
    NEUTRAL = "neutral"
    NEGATIVE = "negative"


model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="text/x.enum",
        response_schema=Sentiment
    ))

response = model.generate_content(zero_shot_prompt)
print(response.text)
### One-shot and few-shot

Providing an example of the expected response is known as a "one-shot" prompt. When you provide multiple examples, it is a "few-shot" prompt.

<table align=left>
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1jjWkjUSoMXmLvMJ7IzADr_GxHPJVV2bg"><img src="https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png" style="height: 24px" height=24/> Open in AI Studio</a>
  </td>
</table>

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash-latest',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        temperature=0.1,
        top_p=1,
        max_output_tokens=250,
    ))

few_shot_prompt = """Parse a customer's pizza order into valid JSON:

EXAMPLE:
I want a small pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni.
JSON Response:
```
{
"size": "small",
"type": "normal",
"ingredients": ["cheese", "tomato sauce", "peperoni"]
}
```

EXAMPLE:
Can I get a large pizza with tomato sauce, basil and mozzarella
JSON Response:
```
{
"size": "large",
"type": "normal",
"ingredients": ["tomato sauce", "basil", "mozzarella"]
}

ORDER:
"""

customer_order = "Give me a large with cheese & pineapple"


response = model.generate_content([few_shot_prompt, customer_order])
print(response.text)
#### JSON mode

To provide control over the schema, and to ensure that you only receive JSON (with no other text or markdown), you can use the Gemini API's [JSON mode](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb). This forces the model to constrain decoding, such that token selection is guided by the supplied schema.
import typing_extensions as typing

class PizzaOrder(typing.TypedDict):
    size: str
    ingredients: list[str]
    type: str


model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash-latest',
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        temperature=0.1,
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=PizzaOrder,
    ))

response = model.generate_content("Can I have a large dessert pizza with apple and chocolate")
print(response.text)
### Chain of Thought (CoT)

Direct prompting on LLMs can return answers quickly and (in terms of output token usage) efficiently, but they can be prone to hallucination. The answer may "look" correct (in terms of language and syntax) but is incorrect in terms of factuality and reasoning.

Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique where you instruct the model to output intermediate reasoning steps, and it typically gets better results, especially when combined with few-shot examples. It is worth noting that this technique doesn't completely eliminate hallucinations, and that it tends to cost more to run, due to the increased token count.

As models like the Gemini family are trained to be "chatty" and provide reasoning steps, you can ask the model to be more direct in the prompt.
prompt = """When I was 4 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now, I
am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Return the answer immediately."""

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
response = model.generate_content(prompt)

print(response.text)
Now try the same approach, but indicate to the model that it should "think step by step".
prompt = """When I was 4 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now,
I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step."""

response = model.generate_content(prompt)
print(response.text)
### ReAct: Reason and act

In this example you will run a ReAct prompt directly in the Gemini API and perform the searching steps yourself. As this prompt follows a well-defined structure, there are frameworks available that wrap the prompt into easier-to-use APIs that make tool calls automatically, such as the LangChain example from the chapter.

To try this out with the Wikipedia search engine, check out the [Searching Wikipedia with ReAct](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Search_Wikipedia_using_ReAct.ipynb) cookbook example.

## Code prompting
### Generating code

The Gemini family of models can be used to generate code, configuration and scripts. Generating code can be helpful when learning to code, learning a new language or for rapidly generating a first draft.

It's important to be aware that since LLMs can't reason, and can repeat training data, it's essential to read and test your code first, and comply with any relevant licenses.
