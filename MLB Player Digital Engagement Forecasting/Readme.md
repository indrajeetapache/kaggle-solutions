**Predict fan engagement with baseball player digital content**

A player hits a walk-off home run. A pitcher throws a no-hitter. A team gets red hot going into the Postseason. We know some of the catalysts that increase baseball fan interest. Now Major League Baseball (MLB) and Google Cloud want the Kaggle community’s help to identify the many other factors which pique supporter engagement and create deeper relationships betweens players and fans.

The sport has a long history of being numbers-driven. Nearly every day from at least April through October, baseball fans watch, read, and search for information about players. Which individuals they seek can depend on player performance, team standings, popularity, among other, currently unknown factors—which could be better understood thanks to data science.

Since at least the early 1990s, MLB has led the sports world in the use of data, showing fans, players, coaches, and media what’s possible when you combine data with human performance. MLB continues its leadership using technology to engage fans and provide new fans innovative ways to experience America’s Favorite Pastime.


MLB has teamed up with Google Cloud to transform the fan experience through data. Google Cloud proudly supports this Kaggle contest to celebrate the launch of Vertex AI: Google Cloud’s new platform to unify your ML workflows.

In this competition, you’ll predict how fans engage with MLB players’ digital content on a daily basis for a future date range. You’ll have access to player performance data, social media data, and team factors like market size. Successful models will provide new insights into what signals most strongly correlate with and influence engagement.

Imagine if you could predict MLB All Stars all season long or when each of a team’s 25 players has his moment in the spotlight. These insights are possible when you dive deeper into the fandom of America’s pastime. Be part of the first method of its kind to try to understand digital engagement at the player level in this granular, day-to-day fashion. Simultaneously help MLB build innovation more easily using Google Cloud’s data analytics, Vertex AI and MLOps tools. You could play a part in shaping the future of MLB fan and player engagement.
